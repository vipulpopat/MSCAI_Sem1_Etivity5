    "* This task provides an insight in how SVMâ€™s try to find a hyperplane (which in two dimensions is a line) which divides two classes with the maximum margin on either side of the hyperplane. You can use the C-parameter as a form of regularization; with this parameter you can allow the SVM to miss-classify certain points to allow a wider margin and thus, hopefully, a better performance out-of-sample."

    "* This task provides an insight in how a kernel can allow the SVM (a linear classifier) to be used on non-linearly separable data sets by casting the data in some higher dimensional space as determined by the kernel you choose. In addition to choosing a suitable kernel, you will find that tuning the hyper-parameters of the SVM is important. Take some time to explore various kernels and values of the hyper-parameters to get a feel for how they affect performance and then use a structured approach to arrive at your final conclusions. Take into consideration the out-of-sample error (simulated and based on theory (see lecture 14 from Learning from Data)). \n",
